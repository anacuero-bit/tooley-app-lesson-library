    "content": "## Building Vocabulary (Ages 7-9, 60 minutes)\n\n**Learning Objective:** Students will learn 8-10 new Hindi/English words related to food and use them in simple sentences.\n\n**Key Points:**\n• Start with familiar foods students eat at home (dal, rice, chapati, sabzi)\n• Add new vocabulary through actions and gestures\n• Practice through movement games and repetition\n• Connect new words to daily experiences\n\n**Main Activity - \"Market Charades\" (25 minutes):**\nDraw simple food items on board. Say: \"I'm going to the market to buy...\" and act out eating/cooking each food. Students guess and repeat the word 3 times together. Then call students up: \"Rohan, show us 'bitter gourd' without speaking!\" Class guesses in new language. Rotate through 8-10 foods, mixing familiar (aam, banana) with new words (karela, bhindi).\n\nUse stones as pretend foods for buying/selling game: \"Two stones for karela, please!\"\n\n**Check Understanding:**\n\"Tell your neighbor: What will you cook for dinner using three words we learned today?\"\n\n**Teacher Tip:**\nIf students are shy, start by having the whole class act together before asking individuals to perform. This builds confidence and ensures everyone participates.",
